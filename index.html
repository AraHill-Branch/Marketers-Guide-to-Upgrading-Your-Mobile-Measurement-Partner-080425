        <h1>A Marketer's Guide to Upgrading Your Mobile Measurement Partner</h1>

        <p>Effective measurement is the cornerstone of any marketing success. As consumer behavior evolves and privacy regulations become more stringent, the ability to accurately track, attribute, and optimize marketing efforts is more critical than ever.</p>
        <p>Mobile measurement partners (MMPs) have long played a vital role in helping brands understand the impact of their campaigns. But many growth teams are operating with outdated measurement tools and methodologies and struggle to keep up with the increasingly complex customer journey.</p>
        <p>This white paper explores why upgrading your MMP is no longer optional — it's essential for sustainable growth.</p>

        <h3>The future of marketing belongs to brands that can:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver seamless, connected experiences across channels</li>
            <li>Accurately measure outcomes while navigating evolving privacy regulations</li>
            <li>Prioritize retention and engagement over costly, perpetual customer acquisition</li>
            <li>Leverage data-driven insights to drive efficiency and personalization</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this can be achieved with the right MMP.</p>

        <h2>The Role of an MMP in Modern Marketing</h2>
        <p>As mobile marketing becomes more sophisticated, the role of an MMP has evolved beyond simple attribution. Today, MMPs are essential for growth-focused brands, serving as the connection between marketing efforts and business outcomes.</p>
        <p>At their core, MMPs empower brands to measure, analyze, and optimize their marketing performance across multiple channels. By collecting and consolidating data from diverse touchpoints — including paid ads, organic search, email, social media, and in-app experiences — MMPs provide a single source of truth. This unified view enables marketers to track the customer journey across channels, optimize campaign performance in real time, prevent data silos, and enhance personalization and retargeting.</p>
        <p>Modern MMPs also provide accurate attribution, which is the foundation of effective marketing measurement. Without it, brands are left making decisions based on incomplete or misleading data, which can lead to wasted ad spend and missed growth opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Key Challenges Marketers Face with Outdated MMPs</h2>
        <p>As the mobile marketing landscape grows increasingly complex, the limitations of outdated MMPs have become more evident. Marketers today are navigating an overwhelming amount of data, tighter privacy regulations, and mounting pressure to prove return on investment (ROI). However, legacy MMPs often fall short in helping brands overcome these challenges, ultimately stifling growth and diminishing marketing efficiency.</p>

        <h3>1. Making Sense of Fragmented Data</h3>
        <p>Outdated MMPs struggle to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unify cross-channel data:</strong> Legacy MMPs often lack the ability to stitch together customer journeys across platforms, devices, and channels. This leaves marketers with disjointed reporting, preventing them from accurately assessing multi-touchpoint conversions.</li>
            <li><strong>Reconcile self-attributing network (SAN) claims:</strong> Major platforms like Google, Meta, and TikTok act as SANs, meaning they often assign themselves full credit for conversions that occur after an ad interaction — whether they truly drove the outcome or not. With outdated MMPs, brands frequently overpay for conversions that may have been influenced by multiple channels.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify and deduplicate conversions:</strong> Without advanced deduplication capabilities, marketers risk counting the same conversion multiple times due to overlapping attribution claims from different networks. This inflates perceived performance and distorts ROI metrics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Navigating Evolving Privacy Changes</h3>
        <p>As privacy regulations tighten and platform policies evolve, outdated MMPs struggle to keep up. Key privacy challenges include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT):</strong> With ATT, apps must request explicit user consent to track user activity across other apps and websites. Users who opt out become anonymized, making it harder for MMPs to accurately attribute installs and in-app events. Outdated MMPs that rely on device-level identifiers for advertisers (IDFAs) are losing visibility into a large portion of iOS users.</li>
            <li><strong>SAN-specific privacy frameworks:</strong> Each ad network now implements its own privacy policies. Legacy MMPs cannot effectively standardize these differing frameworks, creating inconsistencies in attribution reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Data gaps and black boxes:</strong> As privacy regulations reduce visibility into individual user actions, outdated MMPs leave marketers with data gaps and incomplete insights. Without privacy-compliant attribution models, brands risk making decisions based on flawed or partial data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Proving and Maximizing ROI</h3>
        <p>In today's competitive and budget-restricted landscape, marketing teams face mounting pressure to do more with less. Outdated MMPs make it difficult to prove ROI due to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inaccurate or incomplete attribution:</strong> Without accurate attribution, marketers struggle to connect the dots between campaign spending and actual customer value. Legacy MMPs often rely on outdated install-touch models that don't include down-funnel events that are essential in understanding customer engagement and retention.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited cohort and lifetime value (LTV) analysis:</strong> Outdated MMPs provide limited cohort analysis, making it harder for marketers to measure retention, churn, and the true long-term impact of their acquisition efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Time-consuming, manual reporting:</strong> Legacy MMPs often require extensive manual data aggregation and reporting, slowing down decision-making.</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty justifying marketing budgets:</strong> With incomplete or inconsistent attribution, it becomes harder for marketers to demonstrate the effectiveness of their campaigns. This makes it challenging to secure future budgets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Main Considerations When Upgrading Your MMP</h2>
        <p>There are five main areas to consider when you're looking into a new MMP.</p>

        <h3>1. Attribution and Analytics</h3>
        <p>Accurate and reliable attribution is the foundation of effective marketing measurement. A modern MMP should go beyond basic install attribution, offering robust in-app event tracking, advanced privacy-centric attribution, and fraud protection to ensure you're making data-driven decisions with clean, deduplicated insights.</p>

        <h3>2. Deep Linking and User Engagement</h3>
        <p>Deep linking plays a critical role in creating seamless user experiences and driving higher engagement. A next-generation MMP should support both direct and deferred deep linking to accurately route users to the right content, regardless of whether they have the app installed.</p>

        <h3>3. Tech Stack Compatibility and Data Access</h3>
        <p>An MMP's ability to integrate smoothly with your existing tech stack is vital for streamlined operations and efficient data flow. Prioritize solutions with high API thresholds, open software development kits (SDKs), and customizable webhooks to ensure flexibility and scalability.</p>

        <h3>4. Privacy and Compliance</h3>
        <p>A modern MMP should offer privacy-centric attribution techniques to deliver accurate insights while protecting user privacy. It should also avoid risky methods that may violate compliance standards.</p>

        <h3>5. Cross-Device and Omni-Channel Measurement</h3>
        <p>When upgrading your MMP, look for capabilities that track and deduplicate users and events across web, mobile, and connected TV (CTV). A comprehensive, omni-channel view enables you to evaluate marketing performance holistically.</p>

        <h2>Transitioning to a New MMP</h2>
        <p>Switching to a new MMP can seem overwhelming, but we've outlined a few questions you should ask your prospective MMP as well as information you should know about your legacy MMP and systems to make the transition a little easier.</p>
